There are three buttons on the main screen: Practice, Statistics, and Passages.

Under Practice, you can click to go back to the main screen or click Start. Once Start is clicked, a randomly selected passage loaded from a text file is shown on the screen with a countdown on the left. Once it says "Go!", type the passage as quickly as possible. Type each word correctly and it will progress through the passage. Once the passage is complete, it will give you the time spent on that passage as well as your WPM, or Words Per Minute (where the average word is considered to be 5 characters long).

Clicking Statistics brings up your highest WPM, your average WPM, and the number of times you've completed a passage in Practice.

Under Passages, you're able to individiually edit passages. The Left and Right buttons cycle through the available passages. You can save your edits by clicking the save button, as well as creating a new passage with the New button. Empty passages cannot be saved.
